# COVI19 Coronavirus Tracker

This application lists the current number of deaths reported across the globe.

Application developed following tutorial from https://youtu.be/8hjNG9GZGnQ
with only a few improvements and a big difference, the tutorial is specified to present the number of reported cases,
and here I present the number of reported deaths.

As the application provides information of public and current interest, it was also deployed in the environment of
http://www.heroku.com to make the application available dynamically and online to all users.

To see the application running, go to https://rstriquer-coronavirus-tracker.herokuapp.com/
